## Project Setup

First, clone the required repository and install necessary libraries. This involves using Git to clone the `GradientGenerator` repository and installing Python packages like `ultralytics`, `gdown`, `Augmentor`, and `tqdm`.

## Directory Structure

Create the necessary directories for storing background images, training data, validation data, and test data. This organization helps keep the project structured and makes it easier to manage the different datasets.

## Downloading Data

Download the required project data, including input images, background images, and test images from Google Drive. This ensures you have all the necessary resources for the project.

## Generating Backgrounds

Generate background images using the `GradientGenerator` script. This step involves creating various gradient backgrounds that will be used later to create composite images.

## Image Augmentation

Apply various transformations to enhance the diversity of input images. The Augmentor library is used to perform these transformations, which helps in increasing the variety and robustness of the dataset.

## Creating Composite Images

Combine input images with different backgrounds to create composite images. Additionally, generate corresponding labels that will be used for training the YOLO model. This step is crucial for creating a comprehensive dataset that the model can learn from.

## Preparing the Dataset

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Typically, 70% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. This ensures that the model can be properly evaluated on unseen data.

## Training YOLOv8

Train the YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset. This involves specifying various training parameters such as the number of epochs, image size, and augmentation settings to fine-tune the model.

## Validating and Testing

Validate the trained model on the validation dataset and make predictions on the test dataset. This step helps in assessing the performance of the model and ensuring that it generalizes well to new data.

## Results

Display the results of predictions on test images. This involves visualizing the model's predictions to qualitatively assess its performance and identify areas for improvement.
